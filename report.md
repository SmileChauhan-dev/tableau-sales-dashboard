The stacked bar chart highlights how each customer segment contributes to profit within every region.

### Key Insights
- **Central** shows strong profit contribution from Corporate and Home Office, making it a leading region.
- **East** has balanced contributions from Corporate and Home Office but slightly lower profits than Central.
- **South** shows moderate performance; Corporate contributes the most while Home Office is lower.
- **West** relies heavily on Small Business and Corporate, with Corporate generating a large portion of profit.

### Interpretation
Regions with strong **Corporate** segment profits show higher overall profitability. **Central** and **West** exhibit superior diversification across segments.

### Sales Contribution
- Central: ~31.5% (highest)  
- West: ~24.5%  
- East: ~22.9%  
- South: ~21.1%

### Interpretation

## 4. Profit vs Sales Scatter Plot
This visualization shows how profit correlates with sales across all records.

### Key Observations

### Monthly Trends
- Orders range between **16,200 – 21,300**.  
- **May** has the highest order quantity (~21,273).  
- **February, June, and November** show lower demand.

### Interpretation
The business experiences consistent order volume with occasional peaks. Inventory and supply chain planning should account for increased demand in Q2 and dips early and late in the year.

## 6. Key Business Conclusions
